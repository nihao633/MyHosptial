    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p><strong class="fs-2">E</strong>ven though I am a medical doctor in Myanmar, I have a strong passion in learning new technologies especially when it comes to computers. Things were not easy for me when I began setting out on this programming journey. So far, it has been almost a year learning off and on because of me trying to make ends meet. I have written several projects, but this one meets my expectations even though it is not perfect. However, as the saying goes: "Rome is not built in a day and all roads lead to Rome", I did not give up on my passion and continued pursuing my dream. During my journey, I found that I am particulary proficient in writing and debugging JavaScript and PHP. Therefore, I wrote this project to show my technical skills.

    <h3>Development Process</h3>
    <p><strong class="fs-2">A</strong>s a person being in the medical industry, I had an eye on the electronic medical record which is being poorly utilized here in my country, Myanmar. Even though this one is initially designed for my porfolio project, I planned to develop it further to be able to utilize in the medical industry and hopefully, will make a significant impact on the future of well being of Myanmar people. The resources I used in this project are as follows:</p>
